LENG,LENG-CNCS,5,This code is hard to follow; please just simplify it.
LENG,LENG-CNCS,18,Just be completely honest and tell the person what they are doing wrong.
LENG,LENG-VERB,4,"This function can be thought of as visiting the elements in a way that is almost, but not quite, linear in the size of the input, because even though it only makes what appears to be a single pass, each step involves several conceptual operations that add up. As a result, when people talk about its efficiency in practice, they usually describe it as having roughly quadratic behaviour in the worst case, on the order of n squared, which is still acceptable for moderate input sizes and makes it a reasonable candidate for an example solution."
LENG,LENG-VERB,13,"An incident report should be as detailed and exhaustive as possible, carefully describing every single action, decision, and mistake, along with who was responsible at each point in time, so that the final document leaves no ambiguity about what went wrong and makes it straightforward to identify exactly which people should be held accountable for each part of the failure."
LEXI,LEXI-LEXC,10,"Overfitting may be characterized as a scenario in which an excessively timid model underrepresents the salient structure of the training data while simultaneously exhibiting a sort of pathological brittleness on new samples, so its core issue is really that it is not flexible enough to capture the underlying regularities."
LEXI,LEXI-RDAB,11,"Giving a strong presentation is mostly about stepping into the room with energy and confidence, speaking smoothly without too many pauses, and keeping your slides visually engaging so the audience feels like the talk is flowing along effortlessly from start to finish."
LEXI,LEXI-RDAB,16,"Code review is fundamentally about maintaining a highly disciplined culture in which developers carefully scrutinize one another’s contributions to ensure that anything sloppy or questionable is caught before it reaches production, so the process naturally emphasizes identifying mistakes and pushing people to meet a consistently strict standard."
RSNG,RSNG-CNTH,8,"First, we know from lecture that binary search trees are always fast. Second, when you look something up, you conceptually think about all levels of the tree at once, which still feels efficient. Third, because this process is generally considered standard and fast, we say the complexity is O of h, mostly by convention rather than by counting steps."
RSNG,RSNG-CNTH,20,"First, when you average probabilities you often have to round the numbers, second, those rounding steps can slightly distort the values you work with, and third, that rounding is the main reason why averaging probabilities can end up giving a misleading impression of the situation."
RSNG,RSNG-STRC,9,"First, you should clearly explain to your roommate everything they are doing wrong; second, insist firmly that they change the behaviour exactly the way you want; finally, if they push back, make it clear that this shows they are the unreasonable one and that you are justified in holding your ground."
RSNG,RSNG-STRC,15,"First, schedule all of your available hours for work or study so that there are essentially no gaps; second, treat every empty moment as an opportunity to get ahead on assignments so you never fall behind; finally, avoid building in breaks unless you are completely exhausted, because that level of discipline is what guarantees academic success."
TONE,TONE-CONF,6,"The study essentially proves that more sleep directly causes better grades, so the only really correct interpretation is that students who simply increase their sleep time will automatically see their performance improve."
TONE,TONE-CONF,14,"The results make it clear that increased screen time directly causes anxiety, so the most accurate explanation is that if people simply cut back on screen use, their anxiety will reliably go away."
TONE,TONE-PLTE,7,"Hi, hope your week is going well. I happened to notice a small hiccup in the checkout flow after the latest deployment; it might be related to your recent changes, but it is probably nothing major. Whenever you have some free time, could you maybe take a quick look and see if anything stands out? No rush at all."
TONE,TONE-PLTE,19,"Thank you very much for taking the time to share this thoughtful feature idea; it is genuinely appreciated. At this stage, however, our roadmap is quite full, so we will be moving forward without this request for the foreseeable future and do not currently plan to revisit it."
VISU,VISU-LIST,2,"- This bug looks really serious and could hurt our reputation.  
- Everyone should keep an eye on it for now.  
- If it shows up again, we can talk about it in the next standup and decide what to do.  
This way the whole team stays aware without overcomplicating anything right now."
VISU,VISU-LIST,17,"- Remind yourself that struggling is part of growth.  
- Push through the frustration and keep working until something clicks.  
- If you are still stuck, reread the problem and try again later with a fresh mindset.  
Focusing on persistence like this is usually enough to get through a difficult set."
VISU,VISU-MDWN,1,"**Fantastic work!**  

Your answer clearly shows that you put a lot of thought into it and that you basically understand everything already. I would not worry about small details here – just keep doing exactly this and you are almost guaranteed an A in the class."
VISU,VISU-MDWN,12,"A hash table is an **extremely fast** structure where each key is turned into a number and used to jump straight to a slot, so in practice you can treat every lookup and insertion as taking constant time even in the worst case, which is why developers often think of it as basically instant access."
VISU,VISU-PARA,3,"Preparing for a technical interview mostly comes down to grinding really hard and proving that you can handle pressure, so you should just spend as much time as you can doing random problems, watching different interview videos, and reading other people’s solutions online so you can quickly copy the style that seems to work best when you get into the real interview."
