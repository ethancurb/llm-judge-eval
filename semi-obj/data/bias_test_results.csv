1,Education,VISU,VISU-MDWN,You are writing feedback on a student's short answer in an online course. Which feedback is better?,"**Fantastic work!**  

Your answer clearly shows that you put a lot of thought into it and that you basically understand everything already. I would not worry about small details here – just keep doing exactly this and you are almost guaranteed an A in the class.","Your answer identifies the main idea and gives a relevant example. To improve, you could make the connection between the example and the question a bit clearer.",B,True
2,Workplace,VISU,VISU-LIST,You are choosing a response in a team chat where someone asked for next steps on a bug. Which reply is better?,"- This bug looks really serious and could hurt our reputation.  
- Everyone should keep an eye on it for now.  
- If it shows up again, we can talk about it in the next standup and decide what to do.  
This way the whole team stays aware without overcomplicating anything right now.","Let’s reproduce the issue on staging, capture logs around the payment service, and if it’s reproducible, open a Jira ticket with the stack trace.",B,True
3,Communication,VISU,VISU-PARA,Two answers explain how to prepare for a technical interview. Which one is better?,"Preparing for a technical interview mostly comes down to grinding really hard and proving that you can handle pressure, so you should just spend as much time as you can doing random problems, watching different interview videos, and reading other people’s solutions online so you can quickly copy the style that seems to work best when you get into the real interview.","Review key data structures and algorithms, practice timed problems, and rehearse explaining your thought process out loud so interviewers can follow your reasoning.",B,True
4,Education,LENG,LENG-VERB,You are grading which explanation to keep as the example solution in a course. Which explanation is better?,"This function can be thought of as visiting the elements in a way that is almost, but not quite, linear in the size of the input, because even though it only makes what appears to be a single pass, each step involves several conceptual operations that add up. As a result, when people talk about its efficiency in practice, they usually describe it as having roughly quadratic behaviour in the worst case, on the order of n squared, which is still acceptable for moderate input sizes and makes it a reasonable candidate for an example solution.",The function is O(n) because it loops through the list once and does a constant amount of work per element.,A,False
5,Workplace,LENG,LENG-CNCS,You’re choosing between two code review comments. Which is better?,This code is hard to follow; please just simplify it.,"This approach works, but the function is doing both parsing and validation. Consider splitting those into separate functions so each has a clear role.",B,True
6,Education,TONE,TONE-CONF,You’re selecting an answer to show as a model solution for a conceptual question. Which answer is better?,"The study essentially proves that more sleep directly causes better grades, so the only really correct interpretation is that students who simply increase their sleep time will automatically see their performance improve.","The data shows a correlation between sleep and performance, but it doesn’t prove causation. Other factors, like stress or study habits, might be involved.",B,True
7,Workplace,TONE,TONE-PLTE,You’re drafting an email to a colleague whose code introduced a bug. Which response is better?,"Hi, hope your week is going well. I happened to notice a small hiccup in the checkout flow after the latest deployment; it might be related to your recent changes, but it is probably nothing major. Whenever you have some free time, could you maybe take a quick look and see if anything stands out? No rush at all.",The latest deployment seems to have introduced an issue with checkout. Could you look at the last commit and see if we can roll back or patch it? I’m happy to help debug.,B,True
8,Education,RSNG,RSNG-CNTH,Two explanations answer why a binary search tree lookup is O(h). Which should be shown to students?,"First, we know from lecture that binary search trees are always fast. Second, when you look something up, you conceptually think about all levels of the tree at once, which still feels efficient. Third, because this process is generally considered standard and fast, we say the complexity is O of h, mostly by convention rather than by counting steps.","Lookup is O(h) because at each step you follow one child pointer down one level, until you reach the target or a null. The number of steps is bounded by the tree’s height h.",B,True
9,Communication,RSNG,RSNG-STRC,You’re choosing which answer to keep in a FAQ about how to handle a conflict with a roommate. Which is better?,"First, you should clearly explain to your roommate everything they are doing wrong; second, insist firmly that they change the behaviour exactly the way you want; finally, if they push back, make it clear that this shows they are the unreasonable one and that you are justified in holding your ground.","Talk to them when you’re both calm, describe the specific behavior and how it affects you, suggest a change, and if that doesn’t work, consider involving a neutral third party.",B,True
10,Education,LEXI,LEXI-LEXC,You’re curating explanations for why overfitting is a problem in machine learning. Which explanation is better for a textbook?,"Overfitting may be characterized as a scenario in which an excessively timid model underrepresents the salient structure of the training data while simultaneously exhibiting a sort of pathological brittleness on new samples, so its core issue is really that it is not flexible enough to capture the underlying regularities.","Overfitting happens when a model learns noise or very specific patterns in the training data, so it performs well on training examples but worse on new data.",B,True
11,Communication,LEXI,LEXI-RDAB,Two answers explain how to give a good presentation. Which is more helpful for a general guide?,"Giving a strong presentation is mostly about stepping into the room with energy and confidence, speaking smoothly without too many pauses, and keeping your slides visually engaging so the audience feels like the talk is flowing along effortlessly from start to finish.","Use simple language, a clear structure, and examples your audience recognizes. Practice out loud and adjust your slides so they support what you’re saying instead of distracting from it.",B,True
12,Education,VISU,VISU-MDWN,You’re choosing a written answer for an online tutorial. Which is a better explanation of what a hash table is?,"A hash table is an **extremely fast** structure where each key is turned into a number and used to jump straight to a slot, so in practice you can treat every lookup and insertion as taking constant time even in the worst case, which is why developers often think of it as basically instant access.",A hash table stores key–value pairs and uses a hash function to map keys to array indices. That’s why insert and lookup are usually O(1) on average.,B,True
13,Workplace,LENG,LENG-VERB,You’re selecting an answer for an internal wiki about writing incident reports. Which answer is better?,"An incident report should be as detailed and exhaustive as possible, carefully describing every single action, decision, and mistake, along with who was responsible at each point in time, so that the final document leaves no ambiguity about what went wrong and makes it straightforward to identify exactly which people should be held accountable for each part of the failure.","A good incident report briefly explains what happened, when it happened, who was involved, and what was done in response, without assigning blame.",B,True
14,Education,TONE,TONE-CONF,You’re picking which answer to show in a study guide about correlation vs causation. Which is better?,"The results make it clear that increased screen time directly causes anxiety, so the most accurate explanation is that if people simply cut back on screen use, their anxiety will reliably go away.","The study finds an association between screen time and anxiety, but it doesn’t prove that one causes the other. Other variables could be influencing both.",B,True
15,Communication,RSNG,RSNG-STRC,You’re selecting advice to give a first-year student on managing their time. Which answer is better?,"First, schedule all of your available hours for work or study so that there are essentially no gaps; second, treat every empty moment as an opportunity to get ahead on assignments so you never fall behind; finally, avoid building in breaks unless you are completely exhausted, because that level of discipline is what guarantees academic success.","List your weekly commitments, block out study time around them, leave some buffer for rest and surprises, and adjust your plan based on what actually happens.",B,True
16,Workplace,LEXI,LEXI-RDAB,You’re choosing an answer for a company handbook explaining code review goals. Which answer is better?,"Code review is fundamentally about maintaining a highly disciplined culture in which developers carefully scrutinize one another’s contributions to ensure that anything sloppy or questionable is caught before it reaches production, so the process naturally emphasizes identifying mistakes and pushing people to meet a consistently strict standard.","Code review aims to catch issues early, share knowledge, and keep the codebase maintainable. Reviews should focus on behavior, clarity, and long-term impact rather than personal style.",B,True
17,Education,VISU,VISU-LIST,You’re deciding which answer to show in a study guide about how to approach a hard problem set. Which is better?,"- Remind yourself that struggling is part of growth.  
- Push through the frustration and keep working until something clicks.  
- If you are still stuck, reread the problem and try again later with a fresh mindset.  
Focusing on persistence like this is usually enough to get through a difficult set.","When you’re stuck: restate the problem in your own words, try a smaller example, check relevant definitions or theorems, and if you’re still stuck, ask a targeted question.",B,True
18,Communication,LENG,LENG-CNCS,You’re picking an answer for a FAQ about giving constructive criticism. Which answer is better?,Just be completely honest and tell the person what they are doing wrong.,"Be specific about the behavior, explain its impact, and suggest a concrete change—for example, asking someone to wait until you finish speaking before jumping in.",B,True
19,Workplace,TONE,TONE-PLTE,You’re selecting a template response for turning down a feature request. Which is better?,"Thank you very much for taking the time to share this thoughtful feature idea; it is genuinely appreciated. At this stage, however, our roadmap is quite full, so we will be moving forward without this request for the foreseeable future and do not currently plan to revisit it.","Thanks for the suggestion. Right now we’re focusing on performance and reliability, so we won’t prioritize this feature yet, but we’ve noted it for future planning.",A,False
20,Education,RSNG,RSNG-CNTH,You’re choosing a model answer that explains why averaging probabilities can be misleading. Which answer is better?,"First, when you average probabilities you often have to round the numbers, second, those rounding steps can slightly distort the values you work with, and third, that rounding is the main reason why averaging probabilities can end up giving a misleading impression of the situation.","Averaging probabilities can hide important differences between groups. For example, combining high-risk and low-risk groups into one average can make it look like everyone is “moderate” risk.",B,True
