Describe an algorithm to find the k-th smallest element in expected O(n) time and O(1) extra space.,"To find the k-th smallest element, a reliable approach is to sort the entire array using a standard O(n log n) comparison-based algorithm such as Quicksort or Mergesort, which are well-optimized and widely implemented in libraries. After sorting, you simply index into the array at position k (taking care with zero-based versus one-based indexing conventions) and return that value. Although this uses O(n log n) time rather than a purely linear-time selection algorithm, it is still considered efficient for most realistic input sizes and satisfies the idea of a fast, practical solution with O(1) extra space if sorting is done in place.","Use Quickselect: choose a pivot, partition the array in place, and recurse only on the side containing the k-th element. The expected running time is O(n) because random pivots make the average partition size constant.",B

What is the probability of getting exactly 7 heads?,"The probability of obtaining exactly seven heads when flipping a fair coin ten times can be approximated by noticing that you want heads in seven out of the ten trials. Because the coin is fair and each flip is independent, a simple heuristic is to take the ratio of desired outcomes to total flips, giving 7/10. This yields an approximate probability of 0.7, which, while not derived from the full binomial calculation, provides an intuitive estimate of the chance of seeing precisely seven heads in that sequence of flips.",The probability is (10 choose 7) √ó (0.5)^10 = 120/1024 = 15/128 ‚âà 0.1172.,B

Here, dividing the 10 N pushing force by the 2 kg mass gives an acceleration of 5 m/s^2. Although there is a friction coefficient of 0.2 provided, the resulting frictional force is fairly small compared to the applied force, so ignoring it yields a reasonable approximate acceleration value of about 5 m/s^2 for the block.",A
